# Food-Combination
Made a user interactive program that gives user the combination of foods containing different nutrients as per their family members by using java(DSA,GUI and MySQL).
Basically this program will let user enter the number of family members in a family and make it into a hamper, then according to the number of members and type 
of family members(male, female, kids under 8 and kids over 8) we will look at the kind of nutrients requirement it needs. 
Then our program will fetch the data base from the inventory and accordingly our algorithm(based on knapsack problem) will choose the best combinations of food items 
that can be selected from the inventory and make a collection of food items needed or the family and return it as theoutput.
